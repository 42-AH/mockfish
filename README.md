# Mockfish
## A Minimax Chess Engine

![Mockfish1](https://github.com/42-AH/Mockfish/assets/162044943/5608db62-b128-449d-a010-fa8ca6a57051)





Mockfish is a low-level chess AI, powered by the minimax algorithm written in 100% Python.
It has an estimated 1550 ELO on hard mode, with an average accuracy of 87.9%  compared to the leading chess engine.

## MINIMAX
Minmax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario.
This engine calculates every possible combination of moves up to a certain depth, and assignes each ending a score. The higher the score (or lower, depending on the turn,) the better the move. 
## MOVING
Pretty simple, just click where you want to move from to where you want to move

## GUI
I made a simple UI, using tkinter, so that you didn't have to put in chess notations.
